 *
 * Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given
 * tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary
 * tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are
 * null. 
 * 
 * The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the
 * leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes
 * between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * 
 * ⁠          1
 * ⁠        /   \
 * ⁠       3     2
 * ⁠      / \     \  
 * ⁠     5   3     9 
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4
 * (5,3,null,9).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * 
 * ⁠         1
 * ⁠        /  
 * ⁠       3    
 * ⁠      / \       
 * ⁠     5   3     
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2
 * (5,3).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * 
 * ⁠         1
 * ⁠        / \
 * ⁠       3   2 
 * ⁠      /        
 * ⁠     5      
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length
 * 2 (3,2).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * 
 * ⁠         1
 * ⁠        / \
 * ⁠       3   2
 * ⁠      /     \  
 * ⁠     5       9 
 * ⁠    /         \
 * ⁠   6           7
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8
 * (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
