#
# Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in
# the board.
# 
# Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
# where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The
# same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
# [
# ⁠ ['o','a','a','n'],
# ⁠ ['e','t','a','e'],
# ⁠ ['i','h','k','r'],
# ⁠ ['i','f','l','v']
# ]
# 
# Output: ["eat","oath"]
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
