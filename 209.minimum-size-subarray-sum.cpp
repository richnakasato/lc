 * Testcase Example:  '7\n[2,3,1,2,4,3]'
 *
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the
 * minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum ≥ s. If there isn't
 * one, return 0 instead.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem
 * constraint.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of
 * which the time complexity is O(n log n).
