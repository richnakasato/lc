#
# 
# Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray of
# given length k that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the
# maximum average value.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
# Output: 12.75
# Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 1 k n 
# Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
