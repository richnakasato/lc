#
# Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that
# every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all
# keys greater than the original key in BST.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
# ⁠             5
# ⁠           /   \
# ⁠          2     13
# 
# Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:
# ⁠            18
# ⁠           /   \
# ⁠         20     13
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
