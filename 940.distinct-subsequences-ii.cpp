 * Testcase Example:  '"abc"'
 *
 * Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S
 * .
 * 
 * Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac",
 * "bc", and "abc".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "aba"
 * Output: 6

 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * S contains only lowercase letters.
 * 1 <= S.length <= 2000
