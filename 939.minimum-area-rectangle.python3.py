#
# Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a
# rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.
# 
# If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.
#

# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
# Output: 4

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
# Output: 2

# 1 <= points.length <= 500
# 0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000
# 0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000
# All points are distinct.
